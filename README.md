These two files are the different implementations of our API for a made up loyalty and promotions service.
The Index.js file was used in AWS' Lambda service alongside some other services such as DynamoDB and API Gateway.
The yaml file was our first, simpler implementation which was built inside of Postman and made use of mock servers for testing.
Our API is made using the REST (Representational state transfer) standard. The purpose of the API is to maintain and manage the different promotion and loyalty programs for cusport.org. We do this through a number of different queries and paths. But the main objects we have are the promotional codes a customer may use upon check out to give discounts, extra rewards, or any other promotional event we may have. We use a promoCode object to track these values along with the expected expiration date of each promotional event, a description of what it does, an id number to track it, and a discount(percentage off) amount. We also track whether or not a specific promotion is only available to members who are a part of the loyalty program. Our other main pathway is gift cards. The giftCard object tracks the card's id number, code, name, current balance, and expiration date.
